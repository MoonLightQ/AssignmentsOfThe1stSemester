Nice to meet you
Where have you been 
I can show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven and sins
Saw you there and I thought
Oh my god, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play
New money suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't funny rumors fly
And  I know you've heard about me
So hey, let's be friends 
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames 
You can tell me when it's over 
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far 
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name
Cherry lips crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
So you are the king baby I'm your queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait the worst is yet to come
Oh, no
Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with throns
Keep you second guessin' like
Oh my god, who is she
I got drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause darling I'm your nightmare dressed like a daydream

So it's gonna be forever 
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane 
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far 
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane 
But I've got a blank space babe
And I'll write your name


I don't like your little games
Don't like your tilted stage
The role you made me play
Of the fool, no I don't like you

I don't like your perfect crime 
How you laugh when you lie 
You said the gun was mine
Isn't cool, no I don't like you

But I got smarter I got harder in the nick of time
Honey I rose up from the dead I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, Oh

Oh, look what you made me do
Look waht you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me'
Oh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

I don't like your kingdom keys
They once belonged to me 
You asked me for a place to sleep离开军队和大哥放心c'b'z；w
Locked me out and threw a feast

The world moves on another day another day another drama drama
But not for me not for me all I think about is karma
And then the world moves on another day but one thing's for sure
Maybe I got mine but you all get yours

But I got smarter I got harder in the nick of time 
Honey I rose up from the dead I do it all the time 
I've got a list names and yours is in red underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice Oh
//

I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me 
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams

Kne

I'm sorry, the old taylor can't come to the phone right now
Why? Oh, 'cause she's dead


Ah lahmlahlah

I met this girl late last year
She said don't you worry if I disappear
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would Wait
But then I jumped right in 
A week later return
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my times for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me I was never looking for a friend 
Maybe you can swing by my room around ten
Baby bring a lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets until the late AM
Baby if you wanted me then you should've just said
She's singing

Ah lahmlahlah
DON'T FUCK WITH MY LOVE
THAT HEART IS SO COLD
ALL OVER MY ARM
I DON'T WANNA KNOW THAT BABE

AH lahmlahlah
DON'T FUCK WITH MY LOVE 
I TOLD HER SHE KNOWS 
TAKE AIM AND RELOAD
I DON'T WANNA KNOW THAT BABE

For a couple of weeks I
Only want to see her
We drink away the days with a take away pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha
All over the track like a feature
Never want to sleep I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her we make money the same way
Four cities two planes the same day
Those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on the couch
But we should get on a plane 
Or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down
The way that things played out
When she was kissing him
How? I was confused about
She should figure it out while I'm sat here singing

Ah lahmlahlah
DON'T FUCK WITH MY LOVE
THAT HEART IS SO COLD
ALL OVER MY ARM
I DON'T WANNA KNOW THAT BABE

Ah lahmlahlah
DON'T FUCK WITH MY LOVE
I TOLD HER SHE KNOWS
TAKE AIM AND RELOAD 
I DON'T WANNA KNOW THAT BABE
